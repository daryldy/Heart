Heart Observe
=============

Quick Start
-----------
When the app is started, a new record is created and ready for new blood
pressure and pulse values to be entered. 

The new record defaults to the current date and time.
Both the date and time can be changed by touching their current values.

Systolic, Diastolic, and Pulse values are each changed by selecting the
approriate value in the number selecter directly under the cooresponding
title.

To record the location the blood pressure was taken, tap the appropriate
location (forearm or upper arm) and side (left or right).

Any additional notes about the test can be entered in the *notes* section.

The record is saved automatically when you leave the app.
