code cleanup
============

icons
=====
- graph icon - check sizes

privacy policy
==============
- write one
- decide what to do about ads
-- are ads compatible with my privacy policy?

- "If you choose to use charting, most of the data will be available to the ChartDroid app"
-- Can it be restricted to ONLY the ChartDroid app?
---- How to restrict incoming intents to only certain apps?

software license/EULA
=====================
- decide how software should be licensed
- is an EULA needed?

Google Play publish
===================
- screenshots
- promotional text
- icons?

revenue model
=============
- donation???
- free fully functional app (asks for donation in help or about?)
- second fully functional app available with a price (Thanks for donation in help and about)
- both apps would need to share data so user can continue with either app
- look at app called "Cool Reader" - different "donate" apps for different costs!
