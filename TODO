code cleanup
============

icons
=====
- launcher icon
-- 32 bit png
-- with alpha channel for transparency
-- 4 pixel padding on each edge
-- ldpi - 36x36 px
-- mdpi - 48x48 px
-- hdpi - 72x72 px
-- xhdpi - 96x96 px
- ic_menu_account_list
-- use standard icon or check sizes or ???
- cleanup - ensure no extra png files are hanging around
-- no icons in ldpi???

menu/action bar
===============
- redo res/menu/options.xml to corespond with res/menu-large/options.xml

test
====
- smaller/less density screens
- older versions (this will not work)

writing guidelines
==================
see: http://developer.android.com/design/style/writing.html

privacy policy
==============
- write one
- decide what to do about ads
-- are ads compatible with my privacy policy?

- "If you choose to use charting, most of the data will be available to the ChartDroid app"
-- Can it be restricted to ONLY the ChartDroid app?
---- How to restrict incoming intents to only certain apps?
http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html
http://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-tips.html

-- make this an option - if user wants to turn this on make sure they are aware that this may allow other apps on this device to access the heart data 
- TODO - make provider information configurable

- User should have to grant permission to allow ChartDroid to be used.
- Should have some sort of configurable option to specify how long before the app asks for permission again. (Once granted access does not mean that the user will forever want to contine with the access).
- Needs "Setting" to allow for user to turn off access permission at any time.
- if ChartDroid is not available then ask if want to go to the market to get it.

- if users want it, add ability to encrypt the database with a password/phrase of their choice (maybe add note in privacy policy asking if it is wanted)

software license/EULA
=====================
- decide how software should be licensed - done - GPLv3
- is an EULA needed?

Google Play publish
===================
- screenshots
- promotional text
- icons?

revenue model
=============
- donation???
- free fully functional app (asks for donation in help or about?)
- second fully functional app available with a price (Thanks for donation in help and about)
- both apps would need to share data so user can continue with either app
- look at app called "Cool Reader" - different "donate" apps for different costs!
