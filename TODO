TODO
====

- backup keystore

- privacy policy web page

- Should not require an actual record save during a config change. Active record should be separated from edit fragment so it can survive the config change and be redisplayed in the (new) edit fragment like the normal fields that android redisplays itself.

  - Maybe a concept of a draft record. The draft record is saved separately from regular recs. When would a draft record become a real record?

code cleanup
============

icons
=====
- launcher icon
-- 32 bit png
-- with alpha channel for transparency
-- 4 pixel padding on each edge
-- ldpi - 36x36 px
-- mdpi - 48x48 px
-- hdpi - 72x72 px
-- xhdpi - 96x96 px
- ic_menu_account_list
-- use standard icon or check sizes or ???
- cleanup - ensure no extra png files are hanging around
-- no icons in ldpi???

menu/action bar
===============
- redo res/menu/options.xml to corespond with res/menu-large/options.xml

test
====
- smaller/less density screens
- older versions (this will not work)

writing guidelines
==================
see: http://developer.android.com/design/style/writing.html

Google Play publish
===================
- screenshots
- promotional text
- icons?

revenue model
=============
- donation???
- free fully functional app (asks for donation in help or about?)
- second fully functional app available with a price (Thanks for donation in help and about)
- both apps would need to share data so user can continue with either app
- look at app called "Cool Reader" - different "donate" apps for different costs!

Maybe TODO
==========

- if users want it, add ability to encrypt the database with a password/phrase of their choice (maybe add note in privacy policy asking if it is wanted)
