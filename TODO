code cleanup
============

icons

- launcher icon

-- 4 pixel padding on each edge
-- ldpi - 36x36 px
-- mdpi - 48x48 px
-- hdpi - 72x72 px
-- xhdpi - 96x96 px
- ic_menu_account_list
-- use standard icon or check sizes or ???
- cleanup - ensure no extra png files are hanging around
-- no icons in ldpi???

menu/action bar
===============
- redo res/menu/options.xml to corespond with res/menu-large/options.xml

test
====
- smaller/less density screens
- older versions (this will not work)

writing guidelines
==================
see: http://developer.android.com/design/style/writing.html

privacy policy
==============
- write one
- decide what to do about ads
-- are ads compatible with my privacy policy?

- "If you choose to use charting, most of the data will be available to the ChartDroid app"
-- Can it be restricted to ONLY the ChartDroid app?
---- How to restrict incoming intents to only certain apps?

software license/EULA
=====================
- decide how software should be licensed
- is an EULA needed?
- Remove admob library?? -- compatible with GPL???

Google Play publish
===================
- screenshots
- promotional text
- icons?

revenue model
=============
- donation???
- free fully functional app (asks for donation in help or about?)
- second fully functional app available with a price (Thanks for donation in help and about)
- both apps would need to share data so user can continue with either app
- look at app called "Cool Reader" - different "donate" apps for different costs!
