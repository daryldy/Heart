-------

Heart Observe stores heart pressure, pulse and related data that you provide. This
data is stored only on your device.
It does not
associate any other personal identifiable information with the heart data
other that what you could include in the -notes- field.
All the heart data is visible to you through the app and you may delete any or
all the information whenever you like. If you uninstall the application,
all the heart data is removed as well ***VERIFY THIS***
The graphing of your heart data is provided by a different app. To make this
possible, you need to allow Heart Observe to make your heart data available to
other apps on this device. The primary app that would use your data is
ChartDroid but other apps may be able to use it as well. You can turn off this
feature at any time in the Preferences.
No ads are used in Heart Observe. Please support this policy by purchasing the Heart Observe
(donate) app.
